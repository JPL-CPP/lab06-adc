# What Lab CI checks in `Lab6.X`

Every push to `main` runs these automatically. Open the run in the **Actions** tab: the
checklist and the warnings below appear in the run summary and as annotations on your lines.

## 1. It must compile

`xc8-cc -Wall` (or `pic-as` for assembly) exactly as the grader builds it. A red X here is the
only thing that fails the run. Warnings in *your* files are listed with file and line.

## 2. Required structures (the grader's static score)

The run summary shows this list with a check mark for each one it finds in your code.
Comments do not count. These are the same patterns the grader scores.

- [ ] ADC channel/enable configured (ADCON0)
- [ ] ADC reference configured (ADCON1)
- [ ] ADC clock/justification configured (ADCON2)
- [ ] Conversion result read (ADRESH)

## 3. Mistakes this lab is known for

Warnings only: they never turn the check red, but each one has cost a pair real hours on the bench.
The id in brackets is what you will see on the annotation.

- **[L6-ra0analog]** (warns where found) ANSELA = 0 makes RA0 DIGITAL, and the ADC then reads a stuck value. RA0 must stay analog (ANSELAbits.ANSA0 = 1) while the rest is digital.
- **[L6-trisa0]** (warns if missing) RA0 must be an INPUT (TRISAbits.TRISA0 = 1) for the ADC to sample it.
- **[L6-go]** (warns if missing) No conversion is ever started (ADCON0bits.GO = 1).
- **[L6-wait]** (warns if missing) Nothing waits for the conversion to finish before reading the result. Poll GO (or ADIF) first.
- **[L6-adresl]** (warns if missing) ADCON2 is right-justified, so the 10-bit result is ADRESH:ADRESL. ADRESH alone is only the top two bits.

## Generic warnings on every lab

- **[C1]** Writing to PORTx instead of LATx (read-modify-write on the pins).
- **[C2]** __delay_ms/us used but _XTAL_FREQ not defined.
- **[C3]** main() has no while(1) loop.
- **[C4]** Assignment (=) inside an if/while condition.
- **[C5]** An interrupt function exists but GIE is never set.
- **[C6]** No interrupt flag (xxIF = 0) is ever cleared.
- **[C7]** PORTx read but no ANSELx configured (analog pins read 0).
- **[C8]** No TRISx assignment at all.
- **[A1]** Assembly: ANSELx written through the access bank (,a) instead of banksel + ,b.
- **[A2]** Assembly: no #include <xc.inc>.
- **[A3]** Assembly: retfie without ,1.
- **[A4]** Obsolete -presetVec/-pintVec linker flags present.

## What CI cannot see

Timing, wiring, display polarity, a dead breadboard row, the wrong chip in the socket.
A green check means it builds. Behavior is checked on hardware at check-off.
